    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <div class='rule'>
    The standard rules of chess apply in this game with a small number of exceptions.
    </div>

    <div class='rule'>
    1. The game is considered finished when one king is captured.  Alternatively, one player may resign, or both players may agree to a stalemate.
    </div>

    <div class='rule'>
    2. The game does not force a player to move out of check nor does it prevent a player from moving into check.  If the king is in check at the end of a players turn, the other player will have an opportunity to capture the king and win the game.

    3. The loser must voluntarily resign before their king is captured.  If their king is captured, their fair-play deposit will not be refunded.
