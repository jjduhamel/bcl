    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <div class='rule'>
    The standard rules of chess apply in this game with a small number of exceptions.
    </div>

    <div class='rule'>
    The game is considered finished when one king is captured.  Alternatively, one player may resign, or both players may agree to a stalemate.
    </div>

    <div class='rule'>
    The game does not force a player to move out of check nor does it prevent a player from moving into check.  If the king is in check at the end of a players turn, the other player will have an opportunity to capture the king and win the game.
    </div>

    <div class='rule'>
    The loser must voluntarily resign before their king is captured.  If their king is captured, their fair-play deposit will not be refunded.
    </div>

    <div class='rule'>
    At any time, one player may offer a stalemate to the other player.  If the other player accepts, then the wagers and deposits will be refunded for both players.
